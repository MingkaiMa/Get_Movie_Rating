# Get_Movie_Rating
Python script to implement web scraping- Get movie ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes.
The script prompts the users to input movie names, and outputs the movies in the descending order of the ratings, based on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes respectively.

Need to have access to Google search, maybe cannot be used properly by users in Mainland China.
